# Software Engineer Screening Test - Tasks

This repository contains solutions for the **Software Engineer Screening Test**. The tasks cover **JavaScript**, **REST API**, and **SQL** implementations.

## Tasks

### 1. JavaScript
- **Extend JS Date Object**: Added a `daysTo()` method to calculate the number of complete days between two `Date` objects.
- **Order Sales by Total**: Sorted an array of sales objects by the calculated `Total` (amount * quantity).
- **Object Projection**: Created a function to project a source object based on the prototype object, keeping only common properties.

### 2. REST API
- **Google Calendar Free/Busy Intervals**: Developed a function using Google Calendar API to fetch free/busy intervals within a given time range.

### 3. SQL
- **Create Tables and Insert Data**: Created SQL scripts to set up tables (`user`, `user_group`, `groupMembership`) and insert sample data.
- **SQL Queries**: Provided SQL queries to select specific records, such as empty test groups or users named "Victor" who are not in test groups.

## Usage
- For **JavaScript** tasks, run the provided code in a Node.js environment or browser console.
- For the **REST API** task, set up your Google API credentials and replace the `calendarId` and `apiKey`.
- Run the **SQL scripts** in any SQL editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to create and populate the tables.
